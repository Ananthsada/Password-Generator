# Password-Generator

Some are relatively bored like to think of a passowrd to use.

Don't Worry i have a code that can simplify it.

--------------------
How to use this:
--------------------
1. Enter any set of words you want to be part of Password in character.txt. Be it a word or name or SuperHero.
2. Type
   ```python passwd_gen.py```
3. it will prompt with a password 
4. if you have already used that password that will be updated in to entry.txt.
5. Else you can use that password.


That's all

Thanks for considering it.
